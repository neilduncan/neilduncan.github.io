Hello
-----

![Neil Duncan](/images/bio-photo.jpg){: .align-left} I'm Neil Duncan. I've been a professional software developer for over 12 years now, and have been writing code long before that. I have experience managing and running software teams, and have led large software projects from initial conception right through to delivery and maintenance. 

I have a passion for making my code clear, performant, and understandable. I am very evangelical about the concept of [Continuous Delivery](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html), to increase the speed and throughput of software teams. I write my code using [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), and seek to achieve high levels of code coverage to increase the maintainability and reliability of my systems.

I have experience with a number of Agile software development methodologies, and have used Scrum and Kanban extensively. If needed I can help to train and mentor teams, to improve their understanding and implementation of these techniques.

My main field of expertise is ASP.Net website development, with a focus on the [Sitecore](http://www.sitecore.net) Content Management System. I am a Sitecore Certified Software Developer. I have been trained in (and have experience implementing) the Sitecore <abbr title="Digital Marketing System">DMS</abbr> to provide personalized experiences for users.

In the last 5 years, I've built sites for Premier League football clubs ([Manchester City](http://www.mancity.com/) and [Sunderland](http://www.safc.com)), financial firms in the City of London ([Lloyds of London](http://www.lloyds.com)), betting companies ([Betfred](http://www.betfred.com)), broadcasters ([BT Sport](http://sport.bt.com)), record labels ([Ministry of Sound](http://www.ministryofsound.com)), travel companies ([Trafalgar Tours](http://www.trafalgar.com)) and many more. 

Why "Ghostwheel"?
