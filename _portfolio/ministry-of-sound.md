A fresh Sitecore 7 build for a globally recognised club and record label. This was a complicated site, with many different sections including

 - E-commerce for music releases on the record label. This needed to be able to cope with sales on phyiscal disks, iTunes, Google Play and Amazon. All of these needed to be region aware, due to the complicated requirements around music licencing. 
 - Ticketing. The club sells tickets via the website, which required us to build a shopping basket, and integrate with third party payment systems.
 - Event calendar. The club hosts events year round, and needed a way to promote their upcoming calendar.
 - Streaming music. The most popular pages on the site are the ones where you can listen to a variety of streamed music. There was the requirement to cope with both live DJ sets, as well as maintain an archive of old shows.
