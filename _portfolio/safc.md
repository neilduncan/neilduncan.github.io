A full responsive rebuild of the [SAFC](http://www.safc.com) website. This project was a perfect demonstration of the value of a small, focused, integrated team. Design, UX, front end and back end developers all worked closely together to achieve a beautiful end product. The project was managed using SCRUM, and delivered on time and under budget. 

The site uses [Glass Mapper](http://glass.lu/) and [Unicorn](https://github.com/kamsar/Unicorn) to allow for continuous delivery. A change request can come from the club, be in production and in front of users 30 minutes later. High test coverage means that the client has confidence for us to make complex changes without affecting the experience for their fans.
